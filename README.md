# Quantum Portfolio Optimization

This project demonstrates a simple pipeline for portfolio optimization using quantum computing concepts. It loads a configuration file, builds a QUBO model, executes a quantum circuit on a simulator, parses the results and generates reports.

## Requirements

See `requirements.txt` for required Python packages. The pipeline works without real quantum backends by default.

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## Tests

Run all tests using pytest:

```bash
pytest
```
